# Docs

The documentation for [Winter CMS](https://wintercms.com), currently available at https://wintercms.com/docs/.

This documentation is comprised of the general documentation available at https://wintercms.com/docs/v1.2/docs, with two subfolders - `markup` and `ui` - making up the [Markup Manual](https://wintercms.com/docs/v1.2/markup) and [User Interface Manual](https://wintercms.com/docs/v1.2/ui), respectively.

## Branches

The branches of the docs follow the same branching structure that the [Winter CMS repository](https://github.com/wintercms/winter), with `develop` being the current bleeding-edge development branch.

Branch | Version
------ | -------
[`1.2`](https://github.com/wintercms/docs/tree/1.2) | Winter v1.2.x
[`1.1`](https://github.com/wintercms/docs/tree/1.1) | Winter v1.1.x
